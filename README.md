## About
The Snacks Tracker is a web application built with Django. This application allows users to track various snacks, including their names, descriptions, and the user who purchased them.

## Features
- User authentication for secure access to the admin panel.
- Ability to create, read, update, and delete snack items via the Django admin interface.
- Dedicated snack list and snack detail views.
- Responsive navigation bar with links to home and about pages.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.

## User Acceptance Tests
The application includes tests for verifying the correct status codes for the home and about pages and ensuring the appropriate templates are used, including the ancestor template.
